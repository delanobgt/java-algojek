                         Irvin Delano - 03081170007 - 17IS1

          The creator is currently a student in UPH Medan. Enrolled in 2017.
         He is pursuing a degree in Information System. This game is intended
        to be his final project for his first semester. His dream is to become
          a Full Stack Web Developer. Quite a dream, isn't it? To achieve that,
       lots of learning is required. Unfortunately, sometimes, he is just too lazy 
      and lack of motivation. Should fix his mindset though. Despite that, he loves 
      to code, but is terrible in graphic design. Hopefully someday, he could find
                     a little light in the dark realm of design.

                         Last but not least, enjoy the game!!
